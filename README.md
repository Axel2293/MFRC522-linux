# MFRC522-linux (Work in progress)
This project is focused on bringign an interface to interact with the MFRC522 chip on a PICO-PI-IMX8-MINI running on a Kirkstone Linux distro.

## Key implementation concepts
For this implementation the objective is to use the linux API to interact through the SPI protocol using the "linux/spi/spidev.h" interface.

## Pin layout
(To be defined)

# Datasheet
